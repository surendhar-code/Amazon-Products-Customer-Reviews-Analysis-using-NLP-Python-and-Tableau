* It is the **largest Internet-based store(e-commerce) in the world** by total sales and market capitalization.
* It selling **DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, video downloads/streaming, MP3s, audiobooks, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry**. 
* It also makes consumer electronics like **Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV, and Echo**. 
* Amazon also sells products like **USB cables** using the name **AmazonBasics**.
* In this project, I am going to analyze the **consumer reviews for Amazon products like the Kindle, Fire TV Stick, etc.** using **Python and NLP**, gain insights and generate a report from the data by creating **Dashboard using Tableau**.
* With the help of the dashboard or a report, the company can take **effective decisions for future improvement**.
## PURPOSE

* Spyder is a free and open source scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. 
* It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.
### 2. TABLEAU
![](https://koreaprofessional.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tableau2.jpg)
* Tableau is a powerful and fastest growing data visualization tool used in the Business Intelligence Industry.
* It helps in simplifying raw data in a very easily understandable format.
* Tableau helps create the data that can be understood by professionals at any level in an organization.
* It also allows non-technical users to create customized dashboards.
* Data analysis is very fast with Tableau tool and the visualizations created are in the form of dashboards and worksheets.
#### THE BEST FEATURES OF TABLEAU SOFTWARE
* Data Blending
* Realtime Analysis
* Collaboration of data
## TECHNOLOGIES USED
### 1. DATA ANALYSIS
![](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D1BAQG1CsFWMismng/company-background_10000/0/1545256625067?e=2159024400&v=beta&t=6vrZkC7ZoQmnrgPqpg58B8oisQWPzw3eqDT2-uXkYJA)
* Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. 
* The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis.
* A simple example of Data analysis is whenever we take any decision in our day-to-day life is by thinking about what happened last time or what will happen by choosing that particular decision. 
* This is nothing but analyzing our past or future and making decisions based on it. For that, we gather memories of our past or dreams of our future. So that is nothing but data analysis. 
* Now same thing analyst does for business purposes, is called Data Analysis.
### NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*4x5HPrOlbSE0kXzz)
* Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. 
* NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.
#### WHY NLP IS IMPORTANT?
1. **Large volumes of textual data**
* **Natural language processing** helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. 
* For example, NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important. 
2. **Structuring a highly unstructured data source**
* Human language is astoundingly complex and diverse. 
* We express ourselves in infinite ways, both verbally and in writing. 
* Not only are there hundreds of languages and dialects, but within each language is a unique set of grammar and syntax rules, terms and slang. 
* When we write, we often misspell or abbreviate words, or omit punctuation. When we speak, we have regional accents, and we mumble, stutter and borrow terms from other languages. 
#### HOW DOES NLP WORK?
* Natural language processing includes many different techniques for interpreting human language, ranging from statistical and machine learning methods to rules-based and algorithmic approaches. 
* We need a broad array of approaches because the text- and voice-based data varies widely, as do the practical applications. 
* Basic NLP tasks include tokenization and parsing, lemmatization/stemming, part-of-speech tagging, language detection and identification of semantic relationships. 
* If you ever diagramed sentences in grade school, you’ve done these tasks manually before. 
* In general terms, NLP tasks break down language into shorter, elemental pieces, try to understand relationships between the pieces and explore how the pieces work together to create meaning.
